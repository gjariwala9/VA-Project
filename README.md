## CSCI 6612 - Project

## PIP install and dependencies
To set up your environment, we provided a requirements.txt with all required dependencies. Do NOT use any other dependencies other than the ones listed there.

## How to run the Python Code
In case you are using pycharm, you just need to right click any python file and select `Run 'ScriptName.py'` to run it, however **if you are running the python file from a terminal**, run the following (examples here are in related to assignment1):
* For windows, `cd` into the *assignments1* folder and run `set PYTHONPATH=..\..\ && python ScriptName.py`
* For mac/linux, `cd` into the *assignments1* folder and run `export PYTHONPATH=../../ && python ScriptName.py`

This is due to the normal import pathing python uses. This will ensure that you are able to use code from other folders in your project.

## Recommend you to use vscode or pycharm, in case you choose one of this: the root folder should be "VA-Project", the main folder you downloaded from Brightspace.
